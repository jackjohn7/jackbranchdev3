<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>With the recent improvements to net/http as of the Go 1.22
update, I was excited to build an application with no
external dependencies for the web server.</p>
<p>I wouldn't necessarily recommend this to everyone though.
Ensuring that errors are properly bubbled up through
middleware with standard <code>http.HandlerFunc</code> chaining is
not the simplest thing in the world and I didn't
particularly enjoy that. Frameworks like
Echo, Gin, and Chi all make that a
much better experience since their handlers are built to
return errors.</p>
<p>That said, if you're set on sticking to the standard
library, you can build a very capable web application
with less boilerplate code than you could in the past.</p>
<h1>Why Go 1.22?</h1>
<p>If you're unaware, Go 1.22 provides improvements to route
handlers since you can now specify what HTTP method the
route is meant to handle.</p>
<p>Go 1.21</p>
<pre><code class="language-go">http.HandleFunc(&quot;/todos&quot;, func (w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
  switch r.Method {
  case http.MethodGet:
    // respond with some todos in HTML
  case http.MethodPost:
    // respond with the new todo in HTML
  default:
    // return MethodNotAllowed
  }
})
</code></pre>
<p>Go 1.22</p>
<pre><code class="language-go">http.HandleFunc(&quot;GET /todos&quot;, func (w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) { /* Your GET func */} )
http.HandleFunc(&quot;POST /todos&quot;, func (w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) { /* Your POST func */} )

// unsupported methods like DELETE, PUT, and PATCH will get MethodNotAllowed error response
</code></pre>
<p>The code in Go 1.22 is a lot simpler as I think you'll
agree.</p>
<h1>Templates</h1>
<p>For my project, I chose to use
Templ,
but you can absolutely get away with using the standard
<code>html/template</code> templating library. Both just allow us to
create dynamic, server-rendered HTML with ease. The
advantage of Templ is that you get compile-time type-safety
and a powerful syntax for generating your HTML.</p>
