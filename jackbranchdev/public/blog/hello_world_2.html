<h1>The Rewrite</h1>
<h2>Again?</h2>
<p>I decided to rebuild my site again in what may appear to be an
annual tradition. Hopefully this will satisfy me for quite a
while with its lack of glamour and full focus on content and
style. Jackbranchdev2 wasn't the prettiest site in the world,
but it looked alright. My goal with this new site is to have
it look properly good. I want blogposts to reach actual
readers.</p>
<p>I wasn't very motivated to work on my previous site and I for
whatever reason wasn't really enjoying the workflow I had set
up with Astro. Astro is a great framework, and it deserves the
attention it's gotten over the past few years, but I'm simply
not loving it right now. Instead, I'll just stick to plain
HTML+CSS for my personal site as it needs nothing more than
that.</p>
<h1>The Stack</h1>
<p>The stack for this new revision is quite simple again. It is
exclusively Rust and Markdown. I'm using Axum+Askama+HTMX to
render and serve a responsive UI styled with TailwindCSS.</p>
<h2>How does it work?</h2>
<p>When I compile the application, the <code>build.rs</code> file runs and
converts all of my markdown files to structs containing
metadata and paths to the converted HTML. Using the
<code>generation</code> library that is a member of this workspace, I
create a constant value that is accessible to my program at
runtime. Each of the blogposts include their HTML content with
the <code>include_str!</code> macro.</p>
<h3>Code Generation</h3>

<h3>The Server</h3>

<h2>Improvements to make</h2>
<h3>Static-Site Generation</h3>
<p>I'd like to simplify the runtime of the application by having
all of the HTML generated at compile time rather than having
<em>most</em> of the HTML generated at compile time. Currently, all
of the HTML for the blogposts are generated at compile time,
however, they're dynamically placed within the blogpost
template I've written using Askama templating.</p>
<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;h2&gt;{{ post.metadata.title }}&lt;/h2&gt;
{{ post.html|escape(&quot;none&quot;) }}
</code></pre>
<p>However, I could execute these askama functions at compile time
to generate static HTML and remove the need for the
interpolation at runtime. This should reduce some amount of
runtime complexity and allow for more flexibility with the
server. I could for example just generate a folder of HTML
files and serve that with NGINX or any other HTTP server I
desire though I'm fine with my Axum server for now.</p>
