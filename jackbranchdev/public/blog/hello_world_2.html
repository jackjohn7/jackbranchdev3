<h2>Again?</h2>
<p>I decided to rebuild my site again in what may appear to be an
annual tradition. Hopefully this will satisfy me for quite a
while with its lack of glamour and full focus on content and
style. Jackbranchdev2 wasn't the prettiest site in the world,
but it looked alright. My goal with this new site is to have
it look properly good. I want blogposts to reach actual
readers.</p>
