<h1>Why?</h1>
<p>My previous blog was a bit overkill. While I think a solution involving an API and a database for a blog isn't necessarily wrong for more complex blogs with multiple writers, it's simply overkill for my own personal blog. I decided to reduce complexity and rewrite my blog in Astro and serve my blogposts as static markdown files!</p>
<p>Due to the complexity of my previous blog setup, I had to create a CLI tool for publishing blogposts. I would make a directory for the new blogpost containing the markdown file for the content and JSON file for the metadata. The CLI was also capable of updating previously published posts if there was an ID provided. I had to get the ID from the database manually to do this. Since I didn't know Docker at the time, I was just using my production database. I was often debugging issues with the publishing in production which is <em>obviously</em> the best practice.</p>
<p>An entire Go backend wasn't necessary. Go is a fantastic programming language. It's simplicity and high performance makes it great for writing web services like this. However, it's overkill for my needs. Even if I did need a backend, SvelteKit has a backend of its own making a Go webservice unnecessary here. I'm still using Go for other projects, but I've removed it from this project's stack.</p>
<p>SvelteKit is a full-stack framework with SSR out of the box. I really have no need for SSR. My blog is not really that dynamic. It really wouldn't be a big deal if I had to push a new release in order to create a new post. There's nothing wrong with SvelteKit. I'm still using it in other projects, and it's my preferred framework for creating frontend and full-stack web apps.</p>
<h2>Why Astro?</h2>
<p>There are a number of great options out there for generating static sites. Hugo, 11ty, SvelteKit in SSG mode, etc are all great options. Why have I decided to go with Astro?</p>
<p>Astro's first class support for Markdown coupled with its <a href="https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/">Content Collections</a>, support for components from other frameworks, and great integrations with tools I'm used to using made it a no-brainer choice for me. The content collections feature means I get typesafe markdown frontmatter validation for my metadata for each blogpost.</p>
<p>Astro is a fantastic framework with support for static site generation (SSG) which was exactly what I was looking for.</p>
<p>Unlike with my previous blog, getting syntax highlighting for code blocks in posts was a breeze. All I had to do was declare that I wanted to use Shiki for configurations in my <code>astro.config.mjs</code> file. These aren't my only configurations, just the ones relating to Shiki.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">export default defineConfig({
  markdown: {
    shikiConfig: {
      theme: 'dracula'
      wrap: false
    }
  },
});
</code></pre>
<h2>Any regrets with Astro?</h2>
<p>I have no regrets picking Astro for this project. In fact, I've used it in at least two other projects. One for a school goof project, and another for a <a href="https://github.com/jingusjohn/community-boss-api/tree/dev">serious project also related to my school</a>.</p>
<p>I did have a fair amount of trouble getting LSP and syntax highlighting to work properly with Astro. It was particularly broken in JSX-style iteration and conditional rendering of HTML elements as shown in the image below. There would be no highlighting or auto-completion. Worst of all, it wouldn't indent to the next line properly. I've been spoiled by great editing experiences, and I've not been able to carry that over to Astro consistently.</p>
<p><img src="/blog_assets/hello_world/screenshot1.png" alt="Bad highlighting and indentation" /></p>
<p>Content collection types are generated by astro. In order to update them, you have to either run the site in dev mode or run the <code>npx astro sync</code> command. This was extremely annoying. Luckily, I didn't have to do it ever again once I got the blog's types created properly.</p>
<h1>Summary</h1>
<p>Astro is great. Gonna be blogging more from now on.</p>
<h1>Old blog posts</h1>
<p>Two of my three total blog posts on the previous site are no longer relevant. For this reason, I'll just leave them behind. I have some ideas for some new posts though. I'll primarily be using this to document my journey as a developer and share opinions, fixes, etc.</p>
